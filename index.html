          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a <em>product engineer</em> with 15+ years of professional
            experience building web and mobile applications across various
            architectures in cloud and serverless environments.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a proven track record assembling and
            <em
              >managing happy, cohesive and high-performing engineering
              teams</em
            >. Iâ€™ve grown into a manager in progressive people-first companies,
            and I have experience making good teams great.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love
            <em>building tools to make teams and developers more effective</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe in <em>fostering communities</em> online and offline. I
            speak at conferences, run meetups, teach workshops, and contribute
            to open source software projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most importantly I do my best to be a decent, empathetic
            <em>human being</em> whoâ€™s fun to work with. In my free time I
            perform improv and stand-up comedy, write fiction, and pursue other
            creative endeavours.

          <h2>About you</h2>
          <p>
            You are a <em>mission-driven product company</em> with an ethical
            business model. Youâ€™re most likely in consumer products or
            development tooling space.
          </p>
          <p>
            You value
            <em>diversity, inclusion and your employeesâ€™ autonomy</em>. You care
            about the <em>social and human impact</em> of your product, and
            understand that user needs are as important as business goals, if
            not more so.

          <h2>What I can do for you</h2>
          <p>
            I've traveled down both management and technical tracks, and now I
            am primarily interested in
            <em>senior individual contributor</em> roles, or
            <em>technical leadership</em> roles with a strong hands-on
            development component. Here are some of the things I can do for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Architect and implement</em> modern, high-quality web and mobile
            applications and backend systems, combining good programming
            practices and latest tools and technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apply Design Thinking and Agile Software Engineering methodologies
            to <em>run the product development lifecycle</em> from conception to
            production.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Build and lead engineering teams</em> with a focus on diversity
            &amp; inclusion and a fun and sustainable work environment,
            leveraging my network and developer advocacy experience in hiring.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm available primarily on <em>contract</em>, but open to discussing
            <em>FTE positions</em> in the right role in the right company.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="technologies" class="page-break-after">
          <h2>Technologies</h2>
          <p>
            I am highly effective in architecting and engineering web
            applications using <em>Modern JavaScript</em>, and associated Web
            ecosystem standards, tools and practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            My preferred tool for building user experiences is <em>React</em>,
            either as <em>SSR</em>, <em>SSG</em>, or <em>SPA</em> applications.
            I've built and shipped multiple apps for <em>iOS</em> and
            <em>Android</em> using <em>React Native</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a strong preference for working in statically typed
            compile-to-JavaScript languages such as <em>TypeScript</em>,
            <em>Flow</em> and <em>Rescript</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love designing UI/UX in <em>Figma</em>,
            building out UIs with <em>CSS-in-JS</em> libraries, Utility-first
            CSS approaches like <em>Tailwind</em>, and deploying designs at
            scale using design systems and pattern libraries.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have experience building and scaling end-to-end type-safe
            real-time systems using <em>Node</em>, <em>GraphQL</em>,
            <em>gRPC</em>, <em>TRPC</em>, <em>prisma</em>, and
            using with tools like <em>Apollo</em>, <em>Relay</em> and
            <em>urql</em> on the client.
          </p>
          <p>
            Configuring <em>webpack</em> is not my favorite hobby, but I can
            make it do what is needed, along with tools like <em>esbuild</em>,
            <em>Vite</em>, <em>Rollup</em>, <em>Babel</em>, and <em>ASTs</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a full-stack developer I have built and deployed resilient,
            large-scale services to <em>AWS</em>, <em>GCP</em> and <em>Cloudflare</em>
            in containerised, serverless, edge, and PaaS environments.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've spent more time than I'd care to admit writing text editors for the web.
            My current toolset includes <em>ProseMirror</em> and <em>Tiptap</em>, and 
            adding collaborative editing with tools such as <em>Yjs</em> and <em>Automerge</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a solid grasp of <em>software engineering fundamentals</em>
            such as functional and object-oriented programming paradigms,
            database design, and systems architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Iâ€™m also keen to <em>learn new things</em>. Currently, I'm diving
            deeper into real-time, distributed, serverless, and edge computing.
